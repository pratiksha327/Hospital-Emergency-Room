# Hospital-Emergency-Room
Hospital Emergency Room Analysis Dashboard (Excel & SQL)
🔍 Project Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing Hospital Emergency Room (ER) data using SQL and Microsoft Excel to build an interactive dashboard that helps stakeholders monitor patient flow, service efficiency, and overall patient experience.
The dashboard provides actionable insights into patient volume, wait times, satisfaction levels, admissions, and departmental referrals, enabling better operational and strategic decision-making.

🎯 Purpose of the Project
  The main goal of this project is to:
•	Improve Emergency Room efficiency
•	Identify bottlenecks in patient wait times
•	Monitor patient satisfaction trends
•	Support data-driven decisions for resource allocation and service improvement

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
  The main goal of this project is to:
•	SQL – Data exploration, aggregation, and data quality checks
•	Microsoft Excel
•	Power Query (ETL & Data Cleaning)
•	Power Pivot (Data Modeling & DAX)
•	Pivot Tables & Charts
•	Interactive Dashboard Design

📈 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Number of Patients:
•	Total patients visiting the ER per day
•	Daily trends visualized using area sparklines
Average Wait Time:
•	Average time patients wait to see a medical professional
•	Daily trend analysis to identify peak wait periods
Patient Satisfaction Score:
•	Average daily satisfaction score
•	Trend analysis to detect service quality issues

📊 Dashboard Visualizations
The dashboard includes the following charts and insights:
Patient Admission Status:
• Admitted vs. Not Admitted patients
Patient Age Distribution:
• Patients grouped by age categories
Timeliness:
• Percentage of patients seen within 30 minutes
Gender Analysis:
• Patient count by gender
Department Referrals:
• Most frequently referred departments

🧮 SQL Analysis Performed
The following analyses were conducted using SQL:
•	Daily ER patient count
•	Average wait time per day
•	Average patient satisfaction per day
•	Admitted vs. non-admitted patient counts
•	Patient distribution by age group
•	Percentage of patients seen within 30 minutes
•	Patient count by gender
•	Department-wise referral analysis
•	Racial distribution of ER patients
•	Data quality checks for missing or invalid values

📌 Key Insights
•	Identified peak ER visit days and high-wait-time periods
•	Highlighted departments with the highest referrals
•	Tracked patient satisfaction trends and service gaps
•	Improved visibility into ER performance metrics

🚀 Outcome
This project demonstrates strong skills in data analysis, SQL querying, Excel dashboarding, and business insight generation,
making it suitable for healthcare analytics and operational reporting use cases.
